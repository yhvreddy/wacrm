-- Post-migration assertions for the CI job in
-- `.github/workflows/migrations.yml`.
--
-- `supabase db reset` already fails on any statement Postgres rejects,
-- so this is not about syntax. It's about the quieter failure: a
-- migration that applies cleanly and does nothing. Every DDL statement
-- in this repo is guarded with IF NOT EXISTS / ON CONFLICT so the files
-- can be re-run safely, and that same guard turns a typo'd object name
-- into a silent no-op with a green checkmark.
--
-- Keep this thin. It is a smoke test for "did the migrations actually
-- build the schema", not a spec of it — asserting every column here
-- would just be the migrations restated in a second place, drifting.

-- Two things this file has already been burned by, both verified in CI
-- rather than assumed:
--
-- 1. It must contain EXACTLY ONE statement. `supabase db query --file`
--    sends the whole file as a prepared statement, and a second
--    top-level statement fails with the distinctly unhelpful "cannot
--    insert multiple commands into a prepared statement" (commit
--    f91a6c8). Add assertions INSIDE the DO block above; do not append
--    a second one.
--
-- 2. A RAISE in here really does fail the job. A deliberately false
--    assertion (commit 42c7db0, run 31579334056) surfaced as
--    `failed to execute query: error: ...` and exited 1. This is not a
--    decorative green tick.
